# FAQ and Troubleshooting

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How do I upgrade a quarry?

Open the quarry (E), click the "Upgrade" button, review the information about the next level, and click "Confirm". Upgrading requires 1 quarry in your inventory or currency (if configured).

---

### 2. What resources are unlocked at different levels?

By default: stone -- from level 1, metal ore -- from level 3, sulfur ore -- from level 4, HQM ore -- from level 5. Levels are configurable in the configuration.

---

### 3. Can I use diesel fuel instead of Low Grade?

Yes. The quarry accepts both diesel fuel and Low Grade Fuel. Work speed differs depending on the fuel type (configurable in the configuration).

---

### 4. How do I reload the configuration without restarting?

Run the console command: `ql reload`.

---

### 5. Does the system work with pumpjacks?

Yes. Pumpjacks have their own maximum levels and capacity settings.

## Troubleshooting

### "Upgrade" button does not appear

**Cause:** The player does not have the `quarrylevels.use` permission.

**Solution:** Grant the permission: `oxide.grant group default quarrylevels.use`.

---

### Message "You cannot afford this upgrade"

**Cause:** The player does not have a quarry in their inventory or has insufficient funds in their Economics/ServerRewards balance.

**Solution:** Make sure the player has 1 Mining Quarry without a skin in their inventory. Or top up their economy balance.

---

### Quarry shows maximum level

**Cause:** The quarry has already reached the maximum level.

**Solution:** Increase the `"Quarry max level"` value in the configuration if additional levels are needed.
