## Troubleshooting

### Interface does not open
Make sure **ImageLibrary** is installed and loaded. Check the console for image loading errors.

### Player cannot open a case
Verify that the player has enough currency to purchase the case, or that they have the required permission if the case has an access restriction.

### Bonus case is unavailable
The bonus case has a cooldown (24 hours by default). The player will see a timer until the next available opening.

### Cases for playtime are not being awarded
Make sure the **PlaytimeTracker** plugin is installed and that the playtime tracker settings are enabled in the configuration.

### Roulette does not scroll
Check the "Enable item scrolling?" parameter in the configuration. It should be set to `true`.

### Items with zero chance do not drop
The drop chance determines the probability of an item appearing in the roulette. Make sure the total chances are configured correctly and not all items have a minimal chance.
