# Wipe Block

## What does this plugin do?

**Wipe Block** allows your server to automatically block certain items after a wipe for a specified period of time. Players will not be able to use, equip, or craft blocked items until the designated timer expires. The plugin provides a beautiful interface with countdown timers so players always know when access to specific items will be unlocked.

## Key Features

- Flexible blocking of any items with category-based organization (weapons, explosives, armor, and more)
- Individual unlock timers for each item (from minutes to days)
- Beautiful in-game interface with lists of blocked and unlocked items
- On-screen widget with current block status information
- Notifications on item unlock (Notify and UINotify support)
- Blocked item crafting prevention (optional)
- Prevention of placing blocked items in turrets, MLRS, and drones
- ServerPanel integration for display in the server menu
- Gradient color scale for unlock progress

## Requirements

- Rust server with Oxide/uMod
- Recommended plugins (optional): Notify or UINotify (for notifications), ServerPanel (for server menu)

## Quick Start

1. Copy the plugin file to the `oxide/plugins` folder on your server.
2. Restart the server or load the plugin with the `o.load WipeBlock` command.
3. Open the configuration file `oxide/config/WipeBlock.json` and configure item categories and block durations.
4. Reload the plugin after making configuration changes.
5. Verify it works by typing `/block` or `/wipeblock` in chat.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Menu does not open with `/block` | Make sure the commands have not been changed in the configuration. Verify that the plugin is loaded (`o.load WipeBlock`). |
| Items are not blocked after wipe | Check that items with correct ShortNames and block times greater than 0 are specified in the configuration. |
| Player can use blocked items | Make sure the player does not have the `wipeblock.ignore` permission. Verify that "Prevent to use blocked items" is enabled. |
| Crafting of blocked items is not prevented | Enable the "Prevent to craft blocked items" parameter in the configuration. |
| On-screen widget does not display | Check that the "Show on screen?" parameter is enabled in the OnScreen Settings section of the configuration. |
| Gradients are not working correctly | Make sure at least 101 color values are defined in the gradients list. |
