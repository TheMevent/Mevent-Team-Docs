# King Of Hill

## What does this mode do?

**King Of Hill** is an event mode for Multi Events where players compete to reach the highest point on the map. The system tracks each player's maximum height throughout the event and updates the leaderboard in real time. When time runs out, players with the highest recorded positions get rewards.

## Key Features

- Automatic tracking of each player's max height reached
- Real-time leaderboard with UI notifications
- Configurable max allowed height (to filter out cheaters)
- Flexible reward system with items, commands, kits, and plugin calls
- Integration with Multi Events Inventory and Multi Events Leaderboard
- Notify / UINotify support
- Works with both Oxide and Carbon

## Requirements

- **Multi Events** (core plugin) -- required
- **Image Library** -- recommended (for icon display)
- **Notify** or **UINotify** -- optional (for pop-up notifications)
- **Multi Events Inventory** -- optional (for event inventory rewards)
- **Multi Events Leaderboard** -- optional (for global stats)

## Quick Start

1. Install **Multi Events** (if you haven't already)
2. Place the mode file in `oxide/plugins` (or `carbon/plugins`)
3. Restart the server or load the plugin via console
4. The mode auto-registers with Multi Events
5. Configure as needed (see [Configuration](./configuration))

## Permissions

| Permission | Description |
|---|---|
| `multieventskingofhill.start` | Permission to start the event manually |
| `multieventskingofhill.stop` | Permission to stop the event manually |

## Commands

| Command | Description | Required Permission |
|---|---|---|
| `kingofhill.start` | Start the event manually | `multieventskingofhill.start` |
| `kingofhill.stop` | Stop the event manually | `multieventskingofhill.stop` |

See [Commands](./commands) for details.

## How the Event Works

1. **Start** -- Multi Events launches King Of Hill. All players see a UI notification
2. **Competition** -- every second the system checks the position of all active players. If a player's current height is above their previous max (and doesn't exceed the limit), their record updates
3. **Leaderboard** -- the right side of the screen shows the current ranking with player names and their max height
4. **End** -- when time runs out, the system picks winners and hands out rewards

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Event won't start | Make sure Multi Events is installed and loaded. Check the console for errors |
| UI doesn't show | Check if Image Library is installed. Make sure the player hasn't hidden notifications |
| Rewards aren't given | Check reward settings in the config. If using Multi Events Inventory, make sure it's installed |
| Players reaching suspicious heights | Lower the max height value in the config |
