# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### Do I need Multi Events for this mode to work?

Yes. **Multi Events** is a required dependency. Patrol Helicopter Hit is an expansion mode that can't run on its own without the core plugin.

### How does scoring work?

Every hit on the event helicopter earns one point. All hits count, regardless of what weapon you're using.

### What happens when the helicopter is destroyed?

If the helicopter goes down before the timer expires, the event ends automatically. Winners are determined by total hits scored.

### How long does the event last?

10 minutes (600 seconds) by default. The event can also end early if the helicopter is destroyed. You can change the duration with the `Event Duration` setting.

## Configuration

### How do I change the helicopter's health?

Edit the `Helicopter Health` parameter in the config. Higher values mean the helicopter survives longer, giving players more time to score hits.

### How do I set the helicopter spawn position?

Set the coordinates in the `Heli Init Position` parameter. These correspond to in-game map coordinates. Altitude is set separately with `Heli Height above ground`.

### How do I set up rewards?

In the `Awards Settings` section of the config, define rewards for each position. Items, console commands, Kits, and third-party plugin calls are all supported.

### Can I add more prize positions?

Yes. Add extra entries with position numbers (3, 4, 5, etc.) to the `Awards Settings` section, each with its own set of rewards.

## Problems

### The helicopter doesn't spawn when the event starts

Check the position settings in the config. Make sure the coordinates are within the map boundaries.

### Points aren't awarded for hits

Make sure the event is running and you're shooting the event helicopter specifically. Hits on other helicopters (not spawned by the plugin) don't count.

### The UI widget doesn't show up

Check that ImageLibrary is installed and working. Also make sure the player hasn't manually hidden the widget.

### The event ends but rewards aren't given out

Make sure the reward settings in your config are filled in correctly: valid item ShortNames, amounts, and drop chances.
