## Player Commands

Regular players don't have special commands. Participation is automatic -- just attract the helicopter's attention during the active event.

## Scoring Mechanics

Points are awarded based on the helicopter AI's state toward the player:

| Helicopter State | Points |
|---|---|
| **Orbit** (ORBIT) -- helicopter circles around the player | 1 point |
| **Attack** (STRAFE) -- helicopter attacks the player | 2 points |

:::warning Warning
Attracting the helicopter is dangerous -- it will shoot at you! Players need to balance scoring points with staying alive.
:::

## Event End Conditions

The event ends when:
- The event timer expires
- The helicopter is destroyed (health reaches 0)
- An admin stops the event with `helicopterpet.stop`
