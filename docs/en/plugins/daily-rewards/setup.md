# Daily Rewards Installation

This guide will walk you through the entire process of installing the daily rewards plugin.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

### ImageLibrary (Required)

1. Download **ImageLibrary** from [umod.org](https://umod.org/plugins/image-library).
2. Place the `ImageLibrary.cs` file in the `oxide/plugins/` folder.
3. Make sure the plugin loaded without errors.

:::warning Important
Without ImageLibrary, the Daily Rewards plugin **will not work correctly**.
:::

### Additional Dependencies (Optional)

- **Notify** -- for graphical notifications
- **WipeBlock** -- for blocking rewards after wipe
- **NoEscape** -- for blocking rewards during raid/combat
- **AFKAPI** -- for checking AFK status (AFK time is not counted toward cooldown)

## Step 2: Install the Plugin

1. Copy the `DailyRewards.cs` file to your server's `oxide/plugins/` folder.
2. The plugin will load automatically.
3. Check the console for errors.

The configuration file will be automatically created at:
```
oxide/config/DailyRewards.json
```

## Step 3: Set Up Permissions

Grant permission to use the plugin:

```
oxide.grant group default dailyrewards.use
```

For VIP groups with reduced cooldowns:

```
oxide.group add vip
oxide.grant group vip dailyrewards.vip
oxide.group add premium
oxide.grant group premium dailyrewards.premium
```

For permission to edit rewards in the interface:

```
oxide.grant user <steamid> dailyrewards.edit
```

## Step 4: Configure the Timezone and Reset Time

In the configuration, set the desired timezone and daily reset time:

```json
{
 "Daily reset settings": {
 "TimeZone": "Europe/Moscow",
 "Time": "05:00"
 }
}
```

## Step 5: Configure Rewards

In the `"Daily awards"` section of the configuration, set up rewards for each day. Each day can contain:
- Items (by ShortName)
- Commands (with `%steamid%` substitution)
- Plugin rewards

## Step 6: Verify It Works

1. Join the server.
2. Type `/daily` or `/rewards` in chat.
3. The daily rewards interface should open.

## Step 7: Reload the Plugin

After changing the configuration, reload the plugin:

```
oxide.reload DailyRewards
```

## Updating the Plugin

When updating the plugin:

1. Replace the `DailyRewards.cs` file with the new version.
2. The plugin will automatically update the configuration.
3. A message will appear in the console: `Config update detected! Updating config values...`

:::note Note
It is recommended to save a backup of the configuration before updating.
