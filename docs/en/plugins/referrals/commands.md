# Commands and Permissions

## Chat Commands

| `/ref` | Open the referral system UI | Configurable |
| `/referal` | Open the UI (alternative) | Configurable |
| `/promo <code>` | Activate a promo code | Configurable |
| `/code <code>` | Activate a promo code (alternative) | Configurable |

Commands are set in the config. `Commands` opens the UI, `Commands to activate the promo code` handles code activation.
:::

### Usage Examples

Open the UI:
```
/ref
```

Activate a promo code:
```
/promo ABC12345
```

## Console Commands

The plugin doesn't have special admin console commands. Management is done through the config file.

## Permissions

| Permission | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Configurable | Access to the referral system | Empty (available to all) |

:::info Note
The access permission is set in the config under `"Permission (example: referrals.use)"`. If left empty, the plugin is available to all players without restrictions.

## How It Works

### For the Referrer (inviter)

1. Open the UI with `/ref`.
2. Copy your unique promo code.
3. Share the code with other players.
4. When someone activates your code, you'll get a notification.
5. Rewards unlock at certain invite milestones.

### For the Invited Player

1. Get a promo code from a friend.
2. Type `/promo <code>`.
3. If you've played long enough, the code activates.
4. You'll receive a reward for activating (if configured).

### Restrictions

- You can't activate your own promo code.
- A promo code can only be activated once.
- Minimum playtime on the server is required (default: 1 hour).
- Rewards may be blocked during raids, combat, or after a wipe.
