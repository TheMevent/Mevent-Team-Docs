# Installation and Setup

## System Requirements

- Rust server with Oxide/uMod or Carbon
- Installed **ImageLibrary** plugin (required)

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Download and install the **ImageLibrary** plugin by placing it in the `oxide/plugins` folder. This is a required dependency without which the plugin will not work.

### Step 2: Install the Plugin

Place the plugin file in the `oxide/plugins` folder on your server.

### Step 3: Restart or Reload

Restart the server or run the command in the console:

```
oxide.reload Stacks
```

### Step 4: Grant Permissions

Grant the administrator permission to use the plugin:

```
oxide.grant user <steamid> stacks.admin
oxide.grant group admin stacks.admin
```

### Step 5: Initial Setup

1. Join the server and type `/stacks` in chat.
2. In the panel that opens, you will see two tabs: **Items** and **Containers**.
3. On the **Items** tab, you can search and change the stack size for each item.
4. On the **Containers** tab, you can set multipliers for each container type.

## Optional Dependencies

| Plugin | Purpose |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Notify / UINotify | Beautiful popup notifications instead of chat messages |
| LangAPI | Automatic localization of item names |
| FurnaceSplitter | Correct Shift+RMB behavior when splitting items in furnaces |

## Verifying Functionality

After installation, follow these steps to verify:

1. Type `/stacks` in chat -- the management panel should open.
2. Find any item (e.g., "wood") and change its stack size.
3. Pick up that item in your inventory and verify it stacks up to the new value.

## Updating the Plugin

To update, simply replace the plugin file with the new version and run:

```
oxide.reload Stacks
```

Stack and container settings data is saved in data files and will not be lost during updates.
