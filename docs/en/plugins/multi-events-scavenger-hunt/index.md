# Scavenger Hunt

## What does this mode do?

**Scavenger Hunt** is a treasure hunt event mode for Multi Events. A hidden chest with valuable rewards spawns somewhere on the map. All players race to find and open it first. The first player to reach the chest takes all the rewards.

## Key Features

- Chest spawns at a random position on the map
- Configurable chest prefab and skin
- Real-time distance-to-chest display in the UI for all players
- Single winner -- first player to find the chest
- Notify and UINotify notification support
- Built-in UI widget with countdown and distance
- Rewards via items, commands, Kits, and third-party plugins
- Integration with the event inventory (Multi Events Inventory)

## Requirements

| Dependency | Required? |
|---|---|
| **Multi Events** | Yes |
| **ImageLibrary** | Yes |
| Multi Events Inventory | Recommended |
| Multi Events Leaderboard | Recommended |
| Notify / UINotify | Optional |

## Quick Start

1. Install **Multi Events** on your server
2. Place the Scavenger Hunt mode file in the `oxide/plugins` folder
3. Restart the server or load the plugin
4. The config file will be created automatically
5. Configure rewards and chest settings
6. The event is ready to launch through Multi Events or manually via command

## How the Event Works

1. The event starts automatically through Multi Events or manually by an admin
2. A treasure chest spawns at a random location on the map
3. All players see a UI notification with a description, timer, and distance to the chest
4. Players search for the chest, guided by the distance shown in the UI
5. The first player to try opening the chest wins and gets all the rewards
6. The event ends automatically when the chest is found or the timer expires
