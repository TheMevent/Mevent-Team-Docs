# Setup and Configuration

This guide walks you through installing the Helicopter Pet mode for MultiEvents.

## System Requirements

- Rust server with Oxide / uMod / Carbon
- **MultiEvents** plugin installed (required)
- **ImageLibrary** plugin installed (required)

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

### MultiEvents (required)

1. Install **MultiEvents** following its documentation.
2. Make sure the plugin loads without errors.

### ImageLibrary (required)

1. Download **ImageLibrary** from [umod.org](https://umod.org/plugins/image-library).
2. Place `ImageLibrary.cs` in the `oxide/plugins/` folder.

:::warning Important
Helicopter Pet **won't work** without both MultiEvents and ImageLibrary.
:::

## Step 2: Install the Plugin

1. Copy `MultiEventsHelicopterPet.cs` to your server's `oxide/plugins/` folder.
2. The plugin loads automatically and registers with MultiEvents.
3. Check the console for errors.

Config file created automatically:
```
oxide/config/MultiEventsHelicopterPet.json
```

## Step 3: Set Up Permissions

```
oxide.grant group admin MultiEventsHelicopterPet.start
oxide.grant group admin MultiEventsHelicopterPet.stop
```

## Step 4: Configure the Helicopter

Set up these key helicopter parameters in the config:

- **Heli Init Position** -- helicopter spawn position (X, Y, Z coordinates)
- **Heli Height above ground** -- flight height above ground
- **Helicopter Health** -- helicopter health

:::tip Tip
If the spawn position is left at `0, 0, 0`, the helicopter spawns at the map center. Setting a position near active player bases works best.
:::

## Step 5: Test It

```
helicopterpet.start
```

A patrol helicopter spawns on the map and players see the event panel. Attract the helicopter's attention to score points.

## Step 6: Reload the Plugin

```
oxide.reload MultiEventsHelicopterPet
```

:::warning Warning
The Helicopter Pet event is dangerous -- the helicopter will shoot at players! Make sure players know this. Set the helicopter health high enough that it won't get destroyed before the event ends.
