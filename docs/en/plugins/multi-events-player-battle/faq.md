# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### Do I need Multi Events for this mode to work?

Yes. **Multi Events** is a required dependency. Player Battle is an expansion mode that can't run on its own without the core plugin.

### How does scoring work?

Each kill of another player earns one point. If `Check player kills` is enabled, repeat kills on the same player don't count -- each unique victim gives only 1 point.

### Does this work on PvE servers?

Yes. If TruePve is installed, the event can automatically disable it while running (when `Disable TruePve` is on). TruePve is restored after the event ends.

### How long does the event last?

10 minutes (600 seconds) by default. You can change this with the `Event Duration` setting.

## Configuration

### How do I turn off anti-farming protection?

Set `Check player kills` to `false`. Killing the same player will then count every time.

### How do I set up rewards?

In the `Awards Settings` section of the config, define rewards for each position. Items, console commands, Kits, and third-party plugin calls are all supported.

### Can I add more prize positions?

Yes. Add extra entries with position numbers (3, 4, 5, etc.) to the `Awards Settings` section, each with its own set of rewards.

### How do I change the event duration?

Edit the `Event Duration` parameter in the config. The value is in seconds. Reload the plugin after making changes.

## Problems

### Players can't damage each other

If your server uses TruePve, make sure the `Disable TruePve` option is enabled in the config. Without it, the PvP event won't work on PvE servers.

### Points aren't awarded for kills

If `Check player kills` is on, make sure you're killing unique players. Repeat kills on the same person don't count.

### The UI widget doesn't show up

Check that ImageLibrary is installed and working. Also make sure the player hasn't manually hidden the widget.

### The event ends but rewards aren't given out

Make sure the reward settings in your config are filled in correctly: valid item ShortNames, amounts, and drop chances.
