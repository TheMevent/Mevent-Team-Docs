# Skip Night Installation

## Step 1: Install the Plugin

1. Copy the `SkipNight.cs` file into the `oxide/plugins/` folder.
2. The plugin will load automatically.

Configuration file:
```
oxide/config/SkipNight.json
```

## Step 2: Configure Time Settings

Open `oxide/config/SkipNight.json` and configure the `"Time Settings"` section:

```json
"Time Settings": {
 "DayStart": "08:00",
 "NightStart": "20:00",
 "TimeStart": "20:00",
 "TimeEnd": "21:00",
 "TimeSet": "08:00",
 "TimeVote": 60,
 "ForceSkip": true,
 "LengthNight": 5,
 "LengthFastNight": 2,
 "LengthDay": 45,
 "FullMoon": true,
 "MissedNights": 0
}
```

| TimeStart / TimeEnd | Voting window |
| TimeSet | Time that is set when night is skipped |
| TimeVote | Voting duration (seconds) |

| LengthNight / LengthDay | Night and day duration (minutes) |
| LengthFastNight | Accelerated night duration (minutes) |

## Step 3: Configure Voting

```json
"Votes Settings": {
 "VoteCommands": ["voteday", "vt"],
 "VotesCount": 5,
 "UsePercent": true,
 "Percent": 30,
 "EnabledPay": false,
 "SkipCost": 100,
 "RefundWhenCanceled": false
}
```

## Step 4: Verify Operation

1. Wait for night to come (20:00 server time).
2. The voting interface will appear.
3. Type `/voteday` or click the button in the interface.
4. When the threshold is reached (30% of players), the night will be skipped.

## Step 5: Reload the Plugin

```
oxide.reload SkipNight
```
