# Coin Flipping

## What does this plugin do?

**Coin Flipping** adds a coin flip mini-game to the server. Players can place bets and choose a side of the coin (heads or tails). The plugin supports two game modes: against a bot and against another player. The winner receives the payout, and the loser forfeits their bet.

## Key Features

- Play against a bot with configurable bet amounts
- Play against other players in created rooms
- Economy support through plugins (Economics, ServerRewards, etc.) or items
- Visual interface with coin flip animation
- Configurable coin images (heads and tails)
- Sound and visual effects for flipping, winning, and losing
- Configurable minimum and maximum bets for both modes
- Integration with the Notify plugin for sending notifications
