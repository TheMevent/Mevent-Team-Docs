# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### Do I need Multi Events for this mode to work?

Yes. **Multi Events** is a required dependency. NPC Missile Silo is an expansion mode from Expansion Pack 1.

### Does the map need a missile silo?

Yes. The map must have the Missile Silo monument with NPC scientists for the mode to work properly.

### How long does the event last?

10 minutes (600 seconds) by default. You can change this with the `Event Duration` setting.

## Configuration

### How do I set up rewards?

In the `Awards Settings` section of the config, define rewards for each prize position. Items, commands, Kits, and third-party plugin calls are all supported.

### Can I add more prize positions?

Yes. Add new entries with position numbers (3, 4, 5, etc.) to the `Awards Settings` section.

## Problems

### Points aren't awarded for killing scientists

Make sure the event is active and the map has a missile silo with NPCs. Points only count for scientists inside the missile silo zone.

### The UI doesn't show up

Check that ImageLibrary is installed and working correctly.
