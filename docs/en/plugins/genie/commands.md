# Commands and Permissions

## Chat Commands

The Genie plugin has no chat commands for regular players. Players use the lamp as a regular item in their inventory.

## Console Commands

| Command | Description | Who Can Use |
|---|---|---|
| `genie.give <steamid> <genieId>` | Give a lamp to the specified player | Administrators only |

### Usage Examples

Give a lamp with ID "default" to a player:
```
genie.give 76561198012345678 default
```

Give a lamp with ID "vip_lamp" to a player:
```
genie.give 76561198012345678 vip_lamp
```

:::warning Warning
If a non-existent lamp ID is specified or the player is not found, an error message will appear in the console.
:::

## Permissions

Permissions are configured individually for each lamp type in the configuration:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Permission | The permission required to use this lamp type |

If the `Permission` field is left empty (`""`), the lamp is available to all players.

### Permission Configuration Example

If the configuration specifies:
```json
{
 "Permission": "genie.vip"
}
```

Grant the permission:
```
oxide.grant group vip genie.vip
```

## Gameplay Flow

1. The player receives a lamp (via admin command, loot container, or other plugins).
2. The lamp appears as a regular item with a custom skin.
3. Using the item opens the interface.
4. The player clicks "Rub the lamp" to start opening.
5. A progress animation with effects is displayed.
6. Upon completion, the player receives a random reward based on the configured chances.
7. The reward is granted automatically.
