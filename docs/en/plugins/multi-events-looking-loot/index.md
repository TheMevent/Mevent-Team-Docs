# Looking Loot

## What does this mode do?

**Looking Loot** is an event mode for Multi Events where players compete to find and loot items from containers across the map. Each item you grab earns points, and different items can have different values. The player with the most points when time runs out wins.

## Key Features

- Automatic point tracking for every looted item
- Configurable item value table (each item can have its own point multiplier)
- Default point multiplier for items not in the table
- Real-time leaderboard
- Flexible reward system by ranking position
- Integration with Multi Events Inventory and Multi Events Leaderboard
- Notify / UINotify support
- Works with both Oxide and Carbon

## Requirements

- **Multi Events** (core plugin) -- required
- **Image Library** -- recommended (for icon display)
- **Notify** or **UINotify** -- optional (for pop-up notifications)
- **Multi Events Inventory** -- optional (for event inventory rewards)
- **Multi Events Leaderboard** -- optional (for global stats)

## Quick Start

1. Install **Multi Events** (if you haven't already)
2. Place the mode file in `oxide/plugins` (or `carbon/plugins`)
3. Restart the server or load the plugin via console
4. The mode auto-registers with Multi Events
5. Configure the item value table and rewards (see [Configuration](./configuration))

## Permissions

| Permission | Description |
|---|---|
| `multieventslookingloot.start` | Permission to start the event manually |
| `multieventslookingloot.stop` | Permission to stop the event manually |

## Commands

| Command | Description | Required Permission |
|---|---|---|
| `lookingloot.start` | Start the event manually | `multieventslookingloot.start` |
| `lookingloot.stop` | Stop the event manually | `multieventslookingloot.stop` |

See [Commands](./commands) for details.

## How the Event Works

1. **Start** -- Multi Events launches Looking Loot. All players see a UI notification
2. **Competition** -- players search for and loot items from crates, barrels, and other containers across the map. Each item earns points based on its value
3. **Leaderboard** -- the right side of the screen shows the current ranking with names and scores
4. **End** -- when time runs out, the system picks winners and hands out rewards

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Event won't start | Make sure Multi Events is installed and loaded |
| Points not awarded | Check that the item is in the value table or that `Default Score` is non-zero |
| UI doesn't show | Check if Image Library is installed. Make sure the player hasn't hidden notifications |
| Rewards aren't given | Check reward settings in the config. If Multi Events Inventory is enabled, make sure it's installed |
