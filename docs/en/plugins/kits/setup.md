# Kits Setup

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Before installing Kits, you need to install the required plugin:

- **ImageLibrary** -- download and place it in the plugins folder. Without it, the kit interface will not work.

Optional plugins for extended functionality:

| Plugin | Purpose |
|---|---|
| ServerPanel | Integration with the server menu |
| CopyPaste | Distribute buildings through kits |
| Notify / UINotify | Styled popup notifications |
| NoEscape | Block kits during raid/combat |

## Step 2: Load the Plugin

1. Copy the plugin file to the folder:
 - **Oxide**: `server/SERVER_NAME/oxide/plugins/`
 - **Carbon**: `server/SERVER_NAME/carbon/plugins/`

2. The plugin will load automatically. If the server is already running, use:
 ```
 o.reload Kits
 ```

3. After the first load, a configuration file will be created:
 - `oxide/config/Kits.json` (or `carbon/config/Kits.json`)

## Step 3: Configure Main Settings

Open the configuration file and set up:

### Commands
By default, the plugin registers the `/kit` and `/kits` commands. You can change them:
```json
"Commands": ["kit", "kits", "loadout"]
```

### Economy
Configure the payment system for paid kits:
- **Plugin** -- use an economy plugin (Economics, ServerRewards, etc.)
- **Item** -- payment with in-game items (e.g., scrap)

### Auto-wipe
Enable `Automatic wipe on wipe: true` if you want to reset player data on every server wipe.

## Step 4: Create Your First Kit

1. Join the game with administrator privileges
2. Type the `/editkit` command
3. In the visual editor, create a new kit:
 - Specify a name (unique identifier)
 - Add items from your inventory
 - Configure cooldown, price, and access permissions
4. Save the kit

## Step 5: Grant Permissions

Grant the necessary permissions to players or groups:

```
oxide.grant group default kits.kitname
oxide.grant user <steamid> Kits.admin
```

## Step 6: Verification

Join as a regular player (without admin privileges) and verify:
1. The `/kit` command opens the interface
2. Available kits display correctly
3. Claiming a kit works
