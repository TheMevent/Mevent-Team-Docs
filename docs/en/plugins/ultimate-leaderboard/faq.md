# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 1. How do I switch from SQLite to MySQL?

1. Configure the MySQL settings in the configuration.
2. Use the console command to migrate data:
 ```
 leaderboard.migrate
 ```
3. Change `"Storage Type"` to `"MySQL"`.
4. Reload the plugin.

---

## 2. How do I hide myself from the leaderboard?

The player needs the `ultimateleaderboard.hide.self` permission:
```
oxide.grant user <steamid> ultimateleaderboard.hide.self
```

Then the player uses the `/leaderboard.hide` command to toggle visibility.

---

## 3. How do I reset all data?

Run in the server console:
```
leaderboard.wipe
```

For automatic reset on wipe, enable `"Wipe data on new save": true`.

---

## 4. The leaderboard updates slowly. What should I do?

Reduce the caching interval:
```json
"Leaderboard Cache Interval (seconds)": 300
```

Increase the batch size:
```json
"Leaderboard Cache Batch Size": 20
```

:::warning Warning
Updating too frequently may increase server load.

```json
"Count damage/kills to teammates": false,
"Count damage/kills to clan members": false,
"Count damage/kills to friends": false
```

---

## 6. How do I configure awards for top positions?

In the `Awards` section of the configuration, set up award categories and places. Each place can contain a list of items, commands, or plugin rewards.

---

## 7. How do I enable reward logging to Discord?

Specify the Discord webhook URL:
```json
"Discord webhook for log rewards": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
```

---

## 8. How do I add a new tab?

In the `"Tabs"` array, add a new object with a unique name and blocks. Blocks determine which statistics are displayed on the tab.

---

## 9. Statistics data disappears after restart. Why?

Possible reasons:
1. `"Wipe data on new save"` is set to `true` -- data is reset on wipe.
2. Database issues -- check the server logs.
3. The database file is corrupted -- restore from a backup.

---

## 10. How do I enable debug information?

Set `"Show debug information": true`. This will display all statistics updates in the console, which is useful for configuration and diagnostics.

---

## 11. Is GDPR supported?

Yes. Enable the `"Disable IP address logging": true` parameter to disable logging of player IP addresses.
