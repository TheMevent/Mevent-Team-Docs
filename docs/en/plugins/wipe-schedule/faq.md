# FAQ -- Wipe Schedule

## 1. How do I change the time zone in the calendar?

Open the configuration file `oxide/config/WipeSchedule.json` and change the "Time Zone" parameter value. Specify the UTC offset in hours. For example, for Moscow set `3`, for Kyiv -- `2`. After making changes, reload the plugin.

## 2. Can I start the week on Sunday?

Yes. Set the "Start calendar week on Sunday" parameter to `true` in the configuration. By default, the week starts on Monday.

## 3. How do I add a custom event (e.g., raid night)?

Open the calendar (`/wipe`), click "Edit Events", then "Add Event". Select the type "Event", set a name (e.g., "Raid Night"), description, and configure the repeat schedule. To add a translation for a custom event, use the "Your keys in the translator" section in the configuration.

## 4. Why are event icons not displayed?

The plugin requires ImageLibrary to be installed for icon display. Make sure ImageLibrary is installed and working correctly. After installation, reload Wipe Schedule for the icons to load.

## 5. How do I set up a recurring wipe (e.g., every Thursday)?

In the event editor, select the type "Map Wipe" or "Global Wipe". In the date settings, choose "Repeat", then in the days of the week section, check "Thursday". Specify the wipe time. The event will automatically appear on every Thursday in the calendar.

## 6. Can I use custom icons for events?

Yes. When creating or editing an event, you can specify a direct URL to an icon image. The image will be loaded via ImageLibrary and displayed in the calendar. You can also set a default icon for each event type.

## 7. How do I delete an event?

Open the calendar (`/wipe`), click "Edit Events", select the event from the list, and click the "Delete" button. Confirm the deletion.

## 8. An event is showing at the wrong time. How do I fix it?

Check the time zone setting in the configuration. Also use the `wipeschedule.time` console command to see what time the plugin considers current. If the time does not match, adjust the "Time Zone" parameter.

## 9. How do I integrate the plugin with ServerPanel?

The plugin automatically integrates with ServerPanel when it is present. In the configuration, you can choose the display template (V1 or V2) via the "ServerPanel Template" parameter. The calendar will become available as a category in the server menu.

## 10. Are events preserved after a server restart?

Yes. All events and the schedule are saved in the plugin data file and fully restored on server or plugin restart.
