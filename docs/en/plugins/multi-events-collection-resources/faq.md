# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What types of gathering count?

All resource gathering counts: chopping trees, mining rocks and ore, picking plants, and picking up items from the ground. The system tracks all standard resource collection methods in the game.

### How does the multiplier system work?

Final points are calculated by applying three multipliers in sequence:
1. **Tool multiplier** -- depends on which tool the player is using
2. **Item multiplier** -- depends on the type of resource being gathered
3. **Permission multiplier** -- depends on the player's privileges

For example, if base points = 10, tool multiplier = 0.5, item multiplier = 1, permission multiplier = 2, then final points = 10 * 0.5 * 1 * 2 = 10.

### Do players need to register?

No. All players on the server automatically participate.

## Configuration

### How do I balance the event for high-rate servers?

Lower the multipliers for powerful tools (e.g., `jackhammer: 0.3`) and raise them for weak ones (`rock: 2.0`). You can also lower multipliers for commonly gathered resources.

### How do I set up VIP multipliers?

Add the permissions and multipliers you want in the `Permissions Multiplier` config section, then grant those permissions to the right groups through the server's permission system.

### Can I set multipliers for items with a specific skin?

Yes. Each item in the `Items Multiplier` section has a `Skin` parameter. Set the skin ID for an exact match. A value of `0` means the standard item with no skin.

## Technical

### Is the plugin compatible with Carbon?

Yes. It works with both Oxide and Carbon.

### What happens if a player has multiple permission multipliers?

The highest multiplier from all the player's permissions is used. Permission multipliers don't stack additively.

### How does the edit permission work?

Players with the edit permission can change event settings through the in-game UI without touching the config file on the server.
