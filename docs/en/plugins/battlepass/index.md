# BattlePass

## What does this plugin do?

**BattlePass** adds a battle pass system to your server with daily missions, dual currency, reward cases, and VIP bonuses. Players complete 25+ types of missions (gathering, killing, crafting, looting, and more) to earn currency that they spend on cases with randomized rewards.

## Key Features

- Daily missions with 25+ mission types (kill players, mine resources, open crates, craft items, etc.)
- Dual currency system -- two separate currencies for different reward tiers
- Reward cases with randomized loot and animated opening
- VIP multipliers for currency earnings
- Premium cases accessible only with the right permissions
- Challenge of the day with bonus rewards
- Configurable mission refresh frequency
- NoEscape integration to block rewards during raids/combat
- Automatic data wipe support

## Troubleshooting

### Interface doesn't open
Make sure **ImageLibrary** is installed and the player has `battlepass.use`.

### Missions don't refresh
Check the mission refresh settings in the config. Missions reset based on the configured interval and timezone.

### Currency not earned
Verify the mission type matches the player's action. Some missions require specific conditions (like a workbench level or being in a certain zone).
