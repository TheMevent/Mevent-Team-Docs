# Player Battle Configuration

The config file is created automatically when the plugin first loads.

## Main Settings

### Work with Notify?

Enables or disables integration with Notify / UINotify plugins for sending notifications. When disabled, notifications are sent to chat instead.

```json
"Work with Notify?": true
```

### Event Duration

Event duration in seconds. Defaults to 600 seconds (10 minutes).

```json
"Event Duration": 600
```

## PvP Settings

### Disable TruePve

Automatically disables TruePve while the event is running so players can damage each other. TruePve is restored when the event ends.

```json
"Disable TruePve (only for player to player) if event start": true
```

### Check player kills

Enables kill uniqueness checking. When enabled, killing the same player again doesn't count. Each victim gives a max of 1 point.

```json
"Check player kills (1 killed person = 1 point)": true
```

:::tip
This setting prevents point farming where two players take turns killing each other. It's recommended to keep it on.
