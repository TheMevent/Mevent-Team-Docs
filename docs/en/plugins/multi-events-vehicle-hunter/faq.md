# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### Do I need Multi Events for this mode to work?

Yes. **Multi Events** is a required dependency. Vehicle Hunter is an expansion mode that can't run on its own without the core plugin.

### Which vehicles count?

By default, all major Rust vehicle types count: minicopters, boats, horses, snowmobiles, helicopters, trains, bicycles, motorbikes, siege equipment, plus CH-47, Patrol Helicopter, and Bradley APC. The full list is configurable.

### Why do different vehicles give different points?

The scoring is balanced by destruction difficulty. Regular vehicles (minicopter, boat) give 1 point, while rare and tough targets (CH-47 at 20 points, Bradley APC and Patrol Helicopter at 10 points each) give a lot more.

### How long does the event last?

10 minutes (600 seconds) by default. You can change this with the `Event Duration` setting.

## Configuration

### How do I change vehicle point values?

Edit the `Vehicle point` section in the config. The key is the vehicle's short name, the value is the point count. Reload the plugin after making changes.

### How do I add a new vehicle type?

Add a new entry to the `Vehicle point` section in the config with the vehicle's short name and point value. The short name must match the vehicle's ShortPrefabName in Rust.

### How do I set up rewards?

In the `Awards Settings` section of the config, define rewards for each position. Items, console commands, Kits, and third-party plugin calls are all supported.

### Can I add more prize positions?

Yes. Add extra entries with position numbers (3, 4, 5, etc.) to the `Awards Settings` section, each with its own set of rewards.

## Problems

### Points aren't awarded for destroying vehicles

Make sure the vehicle's short name is listed in the `Vehicle point` section of the config. Also verify that the event is actually running.

### The UI widget doesn't show up

Check that ImageLibrary is installed and working. Also make sure the player hasn't manually hidden the widget.

### The event ends but rewards aren't given out

Make sure the reward settings in your config are filled in correctly: valid item ShortNames, amounts, and drop chances.
