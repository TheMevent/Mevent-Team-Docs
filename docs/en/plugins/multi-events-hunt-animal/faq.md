# FAQ and Troubleshooting

## Common Questions

### 1. Which animals count?

By default: chickens (1 point), zombies (2 points), wolves, boars, horses, and stags (4 points), bears, polar bears, tigers, crocodiles, panthers, snakes, and deer (10 points). The full list is in the config and can be customized.

---

### 2. How do I add a new animal?

Open the config and add a new entry to `"Score Table (animal - score)"`:

```json
"Score Table (animal - score)": {
 "chicken": 1.0,
 "new_animal": 5.0
}
```

Use `me.hunt.animals.list` from the server console to get ShortPrefabName values.

---

### 3. Do NPC bot kills count?

No. The plugin only tracks deaths of entities whose ShortPrefabName is in the point table. By default, that's only animals.

---

### 4. Does the kill method matter?

No. Any kill method (weapons, traps, drowning, etc.) counts as long as the attacker is a player.

---

### 5. What if there aren't many animals on the map?

Increase the event duration or wait for animals to respawn. You can also lower point values for rare animals to keep the event balanced.

---

### 6. Can I set different points for the same animal at different levels?

No. Each animal has a fixed point value defined in the config table.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Points aren't awarded for killing animals

**Symptoms:** A player kills animals but points don't register.

**Cause:** The killed animal type isn't in the point table, or the event isn't active.

**Fix:** Check the animal's ShortPrefabName and make sure it's in the `"Score Table (animal - score)"` section. Verify the event is running.

---

### `me.hunt.animals.list` command doesn't work

**Symptoms:** The command doesn't output anything.

**Cause:** The command only works from the server (RCON) console.

**Fix:** Run the command from the server console, not from in-game chat.

---

### Event doesn't register in MultiEvents

**Symptoms:** Hunt Animal doesn't appear in the event list.

**Cause:** MultiEvents wasn't loaded or loaded after Hunt Animal.

**Fix:** Reload the plugin: `oxide.reload MultiEventsHuntAnimal`.

---

### Rewards aren't given

**Symptoms:** The event ends but winners don't get rewards.

**Cause:** `"Put the reward in the MultiEventsInventory?"` is enabled but MultiEventsInventory isn't installed.

**Fix:** Install MultiEventsInventory, or disable the option and set up direct reward delivery.

---

### Event panel doesn't show

**Symptoms:** The event started but the UI panel isn't visible.

**Cause:** ImageLibrary issue or the player hid the panel.

**Fix:** Make sure ImageLibrary is installed and working. The panel will reappear on the next event start.
