# FAQ and Troubleshooting

## Common Questions

### 1. How do I create a new supply signal type?

Open the configuration and add a new object to the `"Supplies"` array. Specify a unique name, skin, and configure the airdrop contents. Reload the plugin.

---

### 2. How do I give a supply signal to a player?

Use the console command: `hsupply.give nickname type amount`. For example: `hsupply.give Player1 heal 1`.

---

### 3. Can I restrict who can open the airdrop?

Yes. In the loot settings of each type, there is an `"Access"` section. Set `"AllPlayers": false` and enable the desired options (`Teammates`, `Friends`, `Clanmates`). Then only the supply signal owner and the specified groups will be able to open the airdrop.

---

### 4. How do I configure supply signals to drop from crates?

In the supply signal type configuration, enable `"Drop" > "Enabled": true` and add containers with drop chances to the `"Containers"` array.

---

### 5. Can supply signals be used together with the Loottable plugin?

Yes. The plugin integrates with Loottable for advanced airdrop content management.

## Troubleshooting

### The airdrop arrives but is empty

**Cause:** Items in the `"Items"` section are configured incorrectly or drop chances are too low.

**Solution:** Check the item ShortNames and increase the drop chances. Make sure `"Amount"` has Min/Max values greater than zero.

---

### The `hsupply.give` command does not work

**Cause:** Incorrect command syntax or a non-existent supply signal type name was specified.

**Solution:** Check the syntax: `hsupply.give [nickname/steamid/all] [signal name] [amount]`. Make sure the signal name matches the `"Name"` field in the configuration.

---

### The supply signal looks like a regular Supply Signal

**Cause:** The skin failed to load or an invalid skin was specified.

**Solution:** Make sure the skin exists in the Steam Workshop. Reload the plugin to re-download skins.
