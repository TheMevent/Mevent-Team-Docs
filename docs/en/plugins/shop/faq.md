# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 1. How do I add items to the shop?

After installing a template with `/shop.install`, open the shop as admin (with `shop.admin` permission) and use the edit mode to add, remove, or modify items. You can set prices, categories, images, limits, and more through the in-game editor.

---

## 2. Can I use in-game items as currency instead of Economics?

Yes. In the `"Economy"` section, set `"Type (Plugin/Item)"` to `"Item"` and specify the `"ShortName"` (e.g., `"scrap"`). Players will pay with that item from their inventory.

---

## 3. How do I set up discounts for VIP players?

In the `"Discount"` section of the config, add a permission with the desired discount percentage:
```json
"Discount (%)": {
 "shop.default": 0,
 "shop.vip": 10,
 "shop.premium": 20
}
```
Then grant the permission: `oxide.grant group vip shop.vip`.

## 4. How do I bind the shop to an NPC?

1. Place an NPC on the server.
2. Look at the NPC and type `/shop.setnpc`.
3. Configure categories for that NPC in the config.

---

## 5. How do I log purchases to Discord?

In the `"Discord Logging Settings"` section, enable the settings you want (Buy, Sell, Transfer), set the webhook URL, and customize the message template.

---

## 6. Can I block the shop after a wipe?

Yes. Set `"Wipe Block"` to `true` and configure `"Wipe Cooldown"` (in seconds). For example, 3600 = 1 hour block after wipe.

---

## 7. How do I allow multiple currencies?

Add extra currencies in the `"Additional Economics"` array. Each currency needs a unique `"ID"`. Items in the shop can be assigned to different currencies.

---

## 8. Players can't sell items. Why?

Check these things:
1. `"Enable selling items?"` must be `true`.
2. The item must have a sell price set in the shop data.
3. The selling containers setting must include the container the item is in (main, belt, wear).

---

## 9. How do I reset shop data on wipe?

Configure the `"Auto-Wipe Settings"` section:
```json
"Auto-Wipe Settings": {
 "Cooldown": true,
 "Players": true,
 "Limits": true
}
```

---

## 10. The shop says "initializing." What's going on?

The plugin is loading item images through ImageLibrary. This usually takes 1-3 minutes after the server starts. Wait for it to finish.
