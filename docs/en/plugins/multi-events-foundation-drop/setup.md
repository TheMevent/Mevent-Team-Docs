# Setup and Configuration

This guide walks you through installing the Foundation Drop mode for MultiEvents.

## System Requirements

- Rust server with Oxide / uMod / Carbon
- **MultiEvents** plugin installed (required)
- **ImageLibrary** plugin installed (required)

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

### MultiEvents (required)

Foundation Drop is an expansion mode and requires MultiEvents.

1. Install **MultiEvents** following its documentation.
2. Make sure the plugin loads without errors.

### ImageLibrary (required)

1. Download **ImageLibrary** from [umod.org](https://umod.org/plugins/image-library).
2. Place `ImageLibrary.cs` in the `oxide/plugins/` folder.

:::warning Important
Foundation Drop **won't work** without both MultiEvents and ImageLibrary.
:::

## Step 2: Install the Plugin

1. Copy `MultiEventsFoundationDrop.cs` to your server's `oxide/plugins/` folder.
2. The plugin loads automatically and registers with MultiEvents.
3. Check the console for errors.

The config file is created automatically:
```
oxide/config/MultiEventsFoundationDrop.json
```

## Step 3: Set Up Permissions

```
oxide.grant group admin MultiEventsFoundationDrop.start
oxide.grant group admin MultiEventsFoundationDrop.stop
```

## Step 4: Configure the Arena

In the config, set:

- **Minimal players to start event** -- minimum player count (at least 2)
- **Arena Settings / Size (matrix NxN)** -- platform size (e.g., 10 = 10x10 foundation grid)

## Step 5: Test It

```
foundationdrop.start
```

The voting phase starts, during which players can join. Once enough players have registered, the game begins.

## Step 6: Configure (optional)

Open `oxide/config/MultiEventsFoundationDrop.json` to adjust:

- **Minimum player count** -- threshold to start
- **Arena size** -- foundation grid size
- **Delays** -- voting and waiting times
- **Final battle settings** -- radiation, weapons, kit
- **Rewards** -- winner reward config
- **Allowed commands** -- which commands work during the event

See [Configuration](./configuration) for details.

## Step 7: Reload the Plugin

After changing the config:

```
oxide.reload MultiEventsFoundationDrop
```

:::tip Tip
Test with a small arena (5x5) and minimum players (2) first to make sure everything works.
