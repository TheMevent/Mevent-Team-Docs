# Operation Fortress Setup

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

### NpcSpawn (required)

The NpcSpawn plugin is required for spawning fortress NPC guards.

### Additional Dependencies

| Plugin | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **PveMode** | Create a PvP zone around the fortress |
| **Notify** / **UINotify** | Event notifications |
| **BetterNpc** | Enhanced NPC behavior |
| **AlphaLoot** | Loot management in containers |
| **MonumentOwner** | Integration with the monument system |
| **MultiEvents** | Managing multiple events |

## Step 2: Install the Plugin

1. Copy the `OperationFortress.cs` file to the `oxide/plugins/` folder.
2. The plugin will load automatically.

Configuration file:
```
oxide/config/OperationFortress.json
```

## Step 3: Configure Building Presets

In the configuration, add building preset names (created in RustEdit) to the `"Building Presets"` array:

```json
"Building Presets": ["OperationFortressBaseOne"]
```

:::warning Important
Building presets must be pre-created in RustEdit and present on the server map.
:::

## Step 4: Configure NPCs

The configuration contains NPC presets with settings:

- **TerritoryGuard** -- territory guards
- **ReinforcementSoldier** -- reinforcements
- **MainGuard** -- main guards
- **TowerGuard** -- tower snipers
- **BossCommandor** -- boss commander (3000 HP)

Each preset is configured separately: health, equipment, weapons, speed, detection range, and more.

## Step 5: Configure the Event

```json
{
 "enableAutoTimer": true,
 "repeatEveryMin": 120,
 "repeatEveryMax": 180,
 "prepairSeconds": 60,
 "duration": 65,
 "towerNeedActivated": 4
}
```

## Step 6: Verify It Works

Launch the event manually:

```
operation.start
```

To stop:

```
operation.stop
```

## Step 7: Reload the Plugin

```
oxide.reload OperationFortress
```
