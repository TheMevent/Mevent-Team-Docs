# Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. What's the difference between Multi Events and Events Manager?

**Events Manager** is an event scheduler. It controls *when* and *which* events run automatically.

**Multi Events** is a display framework. It handles *how* events look to players: the UI, banners, descriptions, leaderboard, and reward inventory.

Both plugins complement each other and can be used together.

## 2. How do I add my own event to the panel?

Edit the config (`oxide/config/MultiEvents.json`) and add a new entry in the "Events" section. Fill in the plugin name, banner, title, icon, and description. Then reload the plugin.

## 3. How do I change the events panel appearance?

Use the built-in visual editor:

1. Grant yourself the permission: `o.grant user your_steamid multievents.edit`
2. Type `/ShowUiEditor` in chat
3. Drag elements around, change colors and sizes
4. Changes save automatically

## 4. How do I set up auto-start for random events?

1. In the config, set `"Enable timer to start random event": true`
2. Set the min and max intervals in seconds:
 - `"Min Events Duration": 3600` (1 hour)
 - `"Max Events Duration": 7200` (2 hours)
3. Make sure at least one event has `"Enabled": true`

## 5. Notifications don't appear when an event starts. What do I do?

Check:
- Is the Notify or UINotify plugin installed?
- Is `"Work with Notify?"` enabled in the config?
- Is `"Enable notify when event start"` enabled?
- Is the event in the notification blacklist?

## 6. How do I hide certain events from notifications?

Add the event's plugin name to the `"BlackList of notify to start event"` array in the config. Events on this list won't trigger pop-up notifications.

## 7. Is the plugin compatible with Carbon?

Yes. Multi Events works with both **Oxide** and **Carbon**. On Carbon, ImageLibrary isn't needed -- the plugin uses Carbon's built-in image system.

## 8. How do I connect the leaderboard and inventory?

1. Install the modules: **MultiEventsLeaderboard** and/or **MultiEventsInventory**
2. In the Multi Events config, enable:
 - `"Use Leaderboard?": true` -- for the leaderboard
 - `"Use Inventory?": true` -- for the inventory
3. Optionally set permissions for each module
4. Reload the plugin

## 9. Can I use custom images?

Yes. All images (banners, icons, backgrounds) are loaded via URL. Put your image URLs in the config. PNG format is recommended. Images are cached through ImageLibrary.

## 10. How do I localize the UI?

Multi Events supports multiple languages through the Oxide language file system. English and Russian are included by default. To change text, edit the language file:

```
oxide/lang/ru/MultiEvents.json
```
