# Events Manager

## What does this plugin do?

**Events Manager** allows your server to centrally manage all server events through a convenient visual interface. The plugin automatically launches events on a schedule, supports dozens of popular events from various developers, and also allows you to disable standard vanilla Rust events. All schedule settings are configured directly in-game through a graphical admin panel.

## Key Features

- **Visual schedule editor** -- configure event launches directly in-game through the interface
- **Three schedule types** -- fixed time (Static), repeat every N minutes (Every), random interval (Random)
- **Support for 50+ events** -- built-in integration with plugins from Mevent, KpucTaJl, Adem, Nivex, and many others
- **Vanilla events** -- manage the helicopter, airdrop, cargo ship, Chinook 47, Santa's sleigh
- **Launch conditions** -- minimum and maximum number of online players to start an event
- **Day-of-week binding** -- launch events only on specific days
- **Random event selection** -- multiple events can be assigned to one schedule slot, and the system will randomly choose one
- **Discord integration** -- event launch notifications via webhooks

## Admin Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/em` | Open the visual event management panel |
| `eventmanager.reset.default` | Reset all data to default values (server console only) |

:::

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| The `/em` command does not work | Check that you have the `EventsManager.use` permission. Use `o.grant user your_steamid EventsManager.use` |
| Events do not launch automatically | Make sure the schedule is configured and the number of players on the server meets the conditions (min/max players) |
| Vanilla events still appear | Check the "Disable vanilla auto events?" setting in the configuration. Some events can be left in the whitelist |
| Event shown as "not loaded" | Make sure the event plugin is installed and loaded on the server |
| Error loading configuration | Check the configuration JSON file for syntax errors. The plugin will output an error to the console |
| Discord notifications not arriving | Make sure the webhook URL is correctly specified in the "Discord web hook" setting |
