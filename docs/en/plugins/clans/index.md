# Clans

## What does this plugin do?

**Clans** provides your server's players with a full-featured clan system with a graphical interface. Players can create and manage clans, invite members, appoint moderators, form alliances with other clans, and track leaderboards. The plugin integrates with Rust's in-game teams, supports clan chat, a friendly fire system, equipment skins, and detailed member statistics.

## Key Features

- **Clan creation and management** -- create a clan with a unique tag, appoint moderators, invite and kick members
- **Alliance system** -- unite clans into alliances with shared chat and friendly fire management
- **Leaderboards and rankings** -- top player and clan tables with a configurable scoring system for kills, gathering, and looting
- **Clan chat** -- separate chat for communication within the clan and between allies
- **Friendly fire** -- flexible friendly fire settings for clans and alliances, including turrets
- **Equipment skins** -- unified clan style with configurable skins for weapons and armor
- **In-game team integration** -- works through Rust's built-in team system (invites, kicks, leaving)
- **Paid features** -- optional fees for clan creation, joining, kicking, and other actions

## Troubleshooting

### Clan interface does not open
**Symptoms:** Player types `/clan`, but nothing happens.
**Cause:** The ImageLibrary plugin is not installed.
**Solution:** Install the ImageLibrary plugin and restart the server. Make sure ImageLibrary loaded successfully.

### Clan tags do not appear in chat
**Symptoms:** Players are in clans, but tags are not visible in chat.
**Cause:** Chat plugin integration is not configured.
**Solution:** Make sure the "Enable clan tags in chat?" option is enabled in the configuration and one of the compatible plugins (BetterChat or IQChat) is installed. Check the tag format in the "Tag format" setting.

### Friendly fire does not work
**Symptoms:** Clan members still deal damage to each other.
**Cause:** Friendly fire is not enabled or the shared mode is being used.
**Solution:** Check the "Use Friendly Fire?" setting in the configuration. If shared friendly fire is used, the clan leader must enable it. Also verify that players are not in ZoneManager whitelisted zones.

### Error when creating a clan: forbidden characters
**Symptoms:** Player receives a message about forbidden characters when creating a clan.
**Cause:** The tag contains characters not in the allowed list, or contains blocked words.
**Solution:** Check the "Clan Tag Settings" in the configuration: the blocked words list and the "Allowed Characters" parameter. Make sure the tag length meets the restrictions (2-6 characters by default).

### Paid features do not deduct balance
**Symptoms:** Clan creation is free even though a fee is configured.
**Cause:** The economy plugin is not installed or configured incorrectly.
**Solution:** Make sure the economy plugin specified in the configuration (e.g., Economics) is loaded. Check the hook names in the "Economy" section are correct.

### Clan data disappears after wipe
**Symptoms:** All clans disappear after a map wipe.
**Cause:** The data clearing option on map change is enabled.
**Solution:** Check the "Purge Settings" -- the "Wipe clans on new map save" and "Wipe players on new map save" parameters. Disable them if you want to preserve clans between wipes.
