## Permissions

### Panel Element Permissions

In Panel System, permissions are configured flexibly -- each element can have its own permission. By default, all permissions are empty, which means access is granted to everyone.

| Element | Where it is set | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Logo | `"Logotype" > "Permission"` | Who sees the server logo |
| Online | `"Players Settings" > "Permission"` | Who sees the online count |
| Sleepers | `"Sleepers Settings" > "Permission"` | Who sees the sleeper count |
| Time | `"Time Settings" > "Permission"` | Who sees the in-game time |
| Buttons (panel) | `"Buttons Setting" > "Permission"` | Who sees the buttons panel |
| Each button | `"Buttons" > [n] > "Permission"` | Who sees a specific button |
| Each event | `"Events" > [n] > "Permission"` | Who sees an event indicator |
| Each economy | `"Economics" > [n] > "Permission"` | Who sees a balance |
| Settings | `"Settings Button" > "Permission"` | Who can open the panel settings window |

### Size Permissions

Each panel element can have multiple sizes (Big, Medium, Small), and a permission can be specified for each size.

### Permission Configuration Example

```
oxide.grant group default panelsystem.online
oxide.grant group vip panelsystem.buttons
oxide.grant group admin panelsystem.settings
```

:::tip Tip
If the `"Permission"` field is left empty, the element is visible to all players. To restrict access, specify the desired permission and grant it through Oxide.
:::

## Quick Buttons

Quick buttons execute commands when clicked. Commands are specified in the configuration:

| Format | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `chat.say /command` | Execute a chat command | `chat.say /shop` |
| `console_command` | Execute a console command | `inventory.open` |

### Button Configuration Example

```json
{
 "Enabled": true,
 "Image": "https://example.com/icon.png",
 "Permission": "",
 "Lang Key (oxide/lang/**/PanelSystem.json)": "BtnShop",
 "Command": "chat.say /shop"
}
```
