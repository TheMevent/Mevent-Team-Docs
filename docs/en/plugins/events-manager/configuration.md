# Configuration

The configuration file is located at:
```
oxide/config/EventsManager.json
```

## Main Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Commands | String array | `["em"]` | List of commands for opening the control panel |
| Disable vanilla auto events? | bool | `true` | Disable standard vanilla Rust events |
| Allowed list of vanilla events | String array | `["event_f15e"]` | Whitelist of vanilla events that will not be disabled |
| Discord web hook | String | `""` | Discord webhook URL for sending event launch notifications |
| Enable event logging to file | bool | `false` | Enable logging of event launches to a file |

## Configuration Example

```json
{
 "Commands": [
 "em"
 ],
 "Disable vanilla auto events?": true,
 "Allowed list of vanilla events": [
 "event_f15e"
 ],
 "Discord web hook": "",
 "Enable event logging to file": false
}
```

## Parameter Descriptions

### Commands

An array of chat commands that open the control panel. You can add multiple commands:

```json
"Commands": ["em", "events", "eventmanager"]
```

### Disabling Vanilla Events

When the `Disable vanilla auto events?` parameter is enabled, the plugin disables automatic launching of all standard Rust events (patrol helicopter, airdrop, cargo ship, Chinook 47, and others).

Events on the `Allowed list of vanilla events` whitelist will not be affected.

### Discord Notifications

Specify the Discord webhook URL in the `Discord web hook` parameter to receive notifications each time an event launches. Notifications are sent as Embed messages with the name of the launched event.

### Event Log

When the `Enable event logging to file` parameter is enabled, all event launches will be recorded in a log file with the time and event name.

## In-Game Configuration

Most settings (schedules, events, categories) are configured through the visual in-game interface (`/em` command). The configuration file contains only global server parameters.

:::info Auto-Update
When the plugin version is updated, the configuration is automatically updated. New events and categories are added automatically.
