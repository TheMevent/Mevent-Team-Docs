# FAQ and Troubleshooting

## Common Questions

### 1. How do I add a new server to the list?

Open the config and add a new object to the `"Servers"` array. Set the IP, Port, and BmID (if available). Reload the plugin.

---

### 2. What's a BmID and why do I need it?

BmID is your server's ID on BattleMetrics. It lets the plugin automatically pull the name, description, online count, and banner. Find your server on [battlemetrics.com](https://www.battlemetrics.com) and copy the ID from the URL.

### 3. How do I change the info refresh interval?

Change the `"Interval updates servers info"` parameter in the config. The value is in seconds (minimum 30).

---

### 4. How do I use a custom banner?

Set the banner URL in the server settings. If no banner is specified, the default from `"Default server banner"` is used.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Server list is empty

**Cause:** The `"Servers"` array in the config is empty or the servers aren't responding.

**Fix:** Add servers to the config. Double-check that IP and Port are correct.

---

### Server info isn't updating

**Cause:** BattleMetrics API is unreachable or the BmID is wrong.

**Fix:** Verify the BmID. Make sure the server has internet access.

---

### Banner isn't loading

**Cause:** The banner URL is unreachable or ImageLibrary isn't installed.

**Fix:** Check the banner URL. Install ImageLibrary for image loading.
