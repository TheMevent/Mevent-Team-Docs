# Setup and Configuration

This guide walks you through installing the Gold Rush mode for MultiEvents.

## System Requirements

- Rust server with Oxide / uMod / Carbon
- **MultiEvents** plugin installed (required)
- **ImageLibrary** plugin installed (required)

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

### MultiEvents (required)

Gold Rush is an expansion mode and requires MultiEvents.

1. Install **MultiEvents** following its documentation.
2. Make sure the plugin loads without errors.

### ImageLibrary (required)

1. Download **ImageLibrary** from [umod.org](https://umod.org/plugins/image-library).
2. Place `ImageLibrary.cs` in the `oxide/plugins/` folder.

:::warning Important
Gold Rush **won't work** without both MultiEvents and ImageLibrary.
:::

## Step 2: Install the Plugin

1. Copy `MultiEventsGoldRush.cs` to your server's `oxide/plugins/` folder.
2. The plugin loads automatically and registers with MultiEvents.
3. Check the console for errors.

Config file created automatically:
```
oxide/config/MultiEventsGoldRush.json
```

## Step 3: Set Up Permissions

```
oxide.grant group admin MultiEventsGoldRush.start
oxide.grant group admin MultiEventsGoldRush.stop
```

For the VIP chance multiplier (optional):
```
oxide.grant group vip MultiEventsGoldRush.vip
```

## Step 4: Test It

```
goldrush.start
```

Players will see the event panel. Mine ore or chop trees -- each swing has a chance to drop bonus items.

## Step 5: Configure (optional)

Open `oxide/config/MultiEventsGoldRush.json` to adjust:

- **Event duration** -- how long the event runs
- **Ore items** -- items and drop chances for mining ore
- **Tree items** -- items and drop chances for chopping trees
- **VIP multipliers** -- chance multipliers for players with specific permissions

See [Configuration](./configuration) for details.

## Step 6: Reload the Plugin

```
oxide.reload MultiEventsGoldRush
```

:::tip Tip
Set drop chances so bonus items are rare enough to be exciting but not so rare that players feel like nothing is happening.
