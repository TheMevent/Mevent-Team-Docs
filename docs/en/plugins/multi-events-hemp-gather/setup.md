# Setup and Configuration

This guide walks you through installing the Hemp Gather mode for MultiEvents.

## System Requirements

- Rust server with Oxide / uMod / Carbon
- **MultiEvents** plugin installed (required)
- **ImageLibrary** plugin installed (required)

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

### MultiEvents (required)

1. Install **MultiEvents** following its documentation.
2. Make sure the plugin loads without errors.

### ImageLibrary (required)

1. Download **ImageLibrary** from [umod.org](https://umod.org/plugins/image-library).
2. Place `ImageLibrary.cs` in the `oxide/plugins/` folder.

:::warning Important
Hemp Gather **won't work** without both MultiEvents and ImageLibrary.
:::

## Step 2: Install the Plugin

1. Copy `MultiEventsHempGather.cs` to your server's `oxide/plugins/` folder.
2. The plugin loads automatically and registers with MultiEvents.
3. Check the console for errors.

Config file created automatically:
```
oxide/config/MultiEventsHempGather.json
```

## Step 3: Set Up Permissions

```
oxide.grant group admin MultiEventsHempGather.start
oxide.grant group admin MultiEventsHempGather.stop
```

## Step 4: Test It

```
hempgather.start
```

Players will see the event panel. Collect hemp on the map to earn points.

## Step 5: Configure (optional)

Open `oxide/config/MultiEventsHempGather.json` to adjust event duration, rewards, and notification settings. See [Configuration](./configuration) for details.

## Step 6: Reload the Plugin

```
oxide.reload MultiEventsHempGather
```

:::tip Tip
Make sure your map has enough wild hemp. Hemp grows mostly in forest and grassland biomes.
